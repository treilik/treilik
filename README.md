### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

to tell a little about me, I am a nerd when it comes to graphs (as in networks).
Because essentially graphs are things with relationships between those things.
For that, almost everything can be seen as a graph and thus it provides an universal way to view the world and to think about it.

Also there are special graphs called trees which aren't nessecarly ðŸŒ² but they are still pretty awesome.
And like in a forest they are all around us - in the languages we use, the data we store and the problems we solve!
