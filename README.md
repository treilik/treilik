### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

to tell a little about me, I am a nerd when it comes to graphs (as in networks).
Because essentially graphs are things with relationships between those things.
For that, almost everything can be seen as a graph and thus it provides an universal way to view the world and to think about it.

Also there are special graphs called trees which aren't nessecarly ðŸŒ² but they are still pretty awesome.
And like in a forest they are all around us - in the languages we use, the data we store and the problems we solve!

I am currently working with heart and soul on an editor for graphs.
This graph editor of mine aims to be a tool to navigate and operate on complex issues.

As much as I am an open-source enthusiast, I'm convinced that software needs care and preparation.
With these thoughts in mind, the graph editor project is not yet ready for publication.

If you want to check out puplished work of me have a look at [bubblelister](https://github.com/treilik/bubblelister) and [bubbleboxer](https://github.com/treilik/bubbleboxer).
Both are libaries which serve as base for the graph editor.
